# Adapter(轉接器)

## 前言
Getting the interface you want from the interface you have.
A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

## 動機
Electrical devices have different power(interface) requirements
- Voltage (5V, 200V)
- Socket/plug type(Europe, UK, USA)

We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
- Some support possible(e.g., 120/220V)

Thus, we use a special device(an adapter) to give us the interface we require from the interface we have
